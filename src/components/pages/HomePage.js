          Mobile Panini is the culmination of the dream of Antonio and Carmen
          Dolcini, who came to America looking to serve people the authentic
          recipes learned from their Sicilian family.
        </p>
        <p>
          Antonio began work as a child in his grandmother's deli where he
          learned the age-old secrets of Sicilian cooking. He refined his
          technique at the Culinary Institute of Milan. His younger brother,
          Carmen, with no less of a love for cooking and good food, also worked
          in the deli and became well-acquainted with the open-air fresh food
          markets of his home town. Carmen too, is a proud graduate of the
          Culinary Institute of Milan.
